Question 1: What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and
libraries?

--> React.js is JavaScript library developed by facebook for building user interfaces, especially for 
single page appications. it allow developers to create resuable ui components 

-> features of React.js
1. Component based architecture
2. virtual dom 
3. one way data binding
4. JSX syntax

-> React vs others frameworks and library 
1. react - component based architecture , Angular - full frameworks, Vue - component based architecture
2. react - Virtual DOM , Angular - Real DOM, Vue - Virtual DOM
3. react - One Way data binding , Angular - Two Way data binding, Vue - Two Way data binding
4. react - single page applications , Angular - Large scale  applications, Vue - Single Page appications


Question 2: Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and component based architecture.

--> 1. Component Based Architecture :

    -> React breaks ui (user interface) into small ,resuable pieces called components. each component is like
    block that contains HTML,CSS and JS 
    -> resuable : write once use multiple times , easier maintain

2. Virtual DOM

-> virtual DOM is like copy of real webpage that React keeps in memory.

-> virtual DOM works like below : 
  1. you change something (like typing in a form).
  2. React creates new virtual DOM (memory copy).
  3. it compares new and old virtual dom.
  4. it finds what changed.
  5. it updates only that parts on real DOM .

-> The Virtual DOM is a smart helper. It checks what changed in your app and updates only those parts on the 
real screen, making your app fast and smooth.

Question 3: What are the advantages of using React.js in web development?

--> Advantages of React.js

1. Component Based Architecture
-> react breaks ui  into small, resuable parts
-> makes code organized and easily maintained

2. Fast Performance with virtual DOM
-> React uses virtual dom to updates only the parts the changed.
-> make app fast 

3. one way data flow
-> Data flows in one direction - from parent to child 

4. supports modern js features
