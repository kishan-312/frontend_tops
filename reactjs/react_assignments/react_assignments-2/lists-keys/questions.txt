==============  Lists and Keys ==============

Question-1 : How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keys when
rendering lists?

---> you can render lists of items using map() function :

    example ====
    
    const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Mango'];

    function FruitList() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
        );
    }

    =====

    -- using key react identify which items have changed, added or removed .

        example ====

        const users = [{ id: 1, name: 'Kishan' },{ id: 2, name: 'Chintan' }];

        function UserList() {
            return (
                <ul>
                {users.map(user => (
                    <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
                ))}
                </ul>
            );
        }

        =====

Question 2: What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?

--->  
    - using keys u can identify elements in a list.
    - help react to which items changed, added, removed during re-rendering.

    React uses keys to : 
    - efficiently update the ui 
    - avoid re-rendering the entire list - only changed items are updated 
    - maintain component state properly during list operations.


    if you don't provide unique key then : 
    - React will warn you in console 
    - React will fallback to index-based rendering which can cause :
        1. incorrect reordering
        2. lost component state 
        3. slower performance
