Question 1: What is React Router? How does it handle routing in single-page applications ?
-->    
    - React Router is standard routing library for react.
    - it enables navigation between different pages in SPA without refreshig browser.


    --> single-page applications the entire app runs on single html page. react router handeles
        routing on the client side. 

        1. url changes are handled in browser without sending requests to the server .
        2. it uses history api to manipulate the browser url. 
        3. it renders correct react component based on the current url, without refreshing the page.
       
    
Question 2: Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch
components in React Router.
-->

    1. BrowserRouter : wraps your app and enabled routing
    ex. 

    import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
    <BrowserRouter>
    {/* all routes/components go here */}
    </BrowserRouter>
    
    2. Route : defines what to render for given path 

    import { Route } from "react-router-dom";

    <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />


    3. Link : create navigation links

    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

    <Link to="/about">About</Link>


    4. Switch : ensures that only the first matching route renders 

    import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";

    <Switch>
    <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
    <Route path="/contact" component={ContactPage} />
    </Switch>
