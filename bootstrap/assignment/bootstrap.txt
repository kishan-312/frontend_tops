question 2: What is boostrap container, and how does it work ?
-->

    - A container in bootstrap is a fundamental layout element used to wrap content and provides proper
    alignment and spacing. It ensures that your content is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes

    ----- Types of bootstrap container (how does it work) -----

    - Bootstrap provides 3 types of container

    1. .container (fixed-width container)
    - centers the content and applies fixed width based on screen sizes
    - On small screens : full width
    - On larger screens : adapts to predefined screen sizes

    2. .container-fluid (full width container)
    - Ideal for fluid layouts where content should cover entire screen
    - Always takes the full width of the viewport, regardless of the screen size.

    3. .container-{breakpoints} (Responsive Container)
    - Allows containers to be fluid until reaching a specific breakpoint.
    - After the breakpoint, it behaves like a fixed container

    example of md :
    ---------------

    - Before md breakpoint: Full width.
    - At md and above: Behaves like .container.

    - use .container if you want centered, responsive layout
    - use .container-fluid if you want full-width container
    - use .container-{breakpoint} if you want fluidity up to certain screen sizes
