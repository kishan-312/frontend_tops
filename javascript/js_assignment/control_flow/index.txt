Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work withan
example.
-->
- Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program.
By default, JavaScript executes code from top to bottom, but we can control this flow using conditional statements, 
loops, and functions.

- if-else Statement in JavaScript
The if-else statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

- Syntax of if-else

if (condition) {
    // Code runs if condition is true
} else {
    // Code runs if condition is false
}


let num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive.");
} else {
    console.log("The number is negative or zero.");
}


Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a
switch statement instead of if-else ?

--> The switch statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on a specific value.
It is an alternative to multiple if-else if statements when checking a single variable against multiple possible values.

- Syntax of switch

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code executes if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code executes if expression === value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code executes if no cases match
}

- When to Use switch Instead of if-else :

Use if-else When	                                Use switch When
- Comparing ranges (e.g., if (age > 18))	          Comparing a single value to multiple cases
- Conditions involve complex logic                    There are many fixed options (e.g., menu choices, days of the week)
(e.g., multiple variables)
