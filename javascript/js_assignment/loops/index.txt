Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic
example of each.
--> Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. 
JavaScript has three main types of loops:

- for Loop
- while Loop
- do-while Loop


1. for Loop
The for loop runs a block of code a fixed number of times.

- Syntax

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Initialization: Declares and initializes a loop variable.

Condition: The loop runs while this condition is true.

Update: Changes the loop variable after each iteration.

- Example: Print numbers 1 to 10

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. while Loop
The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. 
It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

- Syntax

while (condition) {

}
- Example: Print numbers 1 to 5

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;  
}

3. do-while Loop
The do-while loop executes the code at least once, even if the condition is false.

- Syntax

do {
} while (condition);
- Example: Print numbers 1 to 5

let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);


Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
--> 
    Both while and do-while loops execute a block of code while a condition is true, 
    but there is a key difference in when the condition is checked.

    1. while Loop
    -  Condition is checked first â†’ If false, the loop does not execute at all.
    while (condition) {
    // Code executes only if condition is true
    }

    2. do-while Loop
    - Code executes at least once, then the condition is checked.

    Syntax

    do {
        // Code executes at least once
    } while (condition);
