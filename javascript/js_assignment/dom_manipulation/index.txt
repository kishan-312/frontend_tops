Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript
interact with the DOM?
-->
    
    The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by the browser for web documents. 
    It represents the page as a tree structure where each node corresponds to a part of the document, 
    such as an element, attribute, or text. Essentially, the DOM is a way for programs (like JavaScript)
    to interact with the content, structure, and style of a web page.

    JavaScript interacts with the DOM by manipulating the tree structure, which represents the HTML document.
    It can modify elements, attributes, and content dynamically, allowing for interactive and responsive web pages.


Question 2: Explain the methods getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(),and
querySelector() used to select elements from the DOM
--> 
    JavaScript provides several methods to access and manipulate elements in the DOM. Three commonly used methods are:

    1. getElementById()
    2. getElementsByClassName()
    3. querySelector()


    1. getElementById() :
    The getElementById() method is used to access a single element in the DOM by its unique ID attribute.
    It returns the first element with the matching ID

    2. getElementsByClassName() :
    The getElementsByClassName() method is used to access all elements that have a specific class name. 
    This method returns a live HTMLCollection (an array-like object) of elements, which means it is
    updated automatically when the DOM changes.

    3. querySelector() :
    The querySelector() method allows for more flexible selection by accepting CSS selectors as arguments.
    It returns the first matching element based on the specified CSS selector. You can use this method to
    select by ID, class, tag, attribute, or any valid CSS selector.
