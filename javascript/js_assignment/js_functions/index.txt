Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a
function.
--> A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code,
 avoid repetition, and make programs easier to maintain.

- Syntax for Declaring and Calling a Function
A function must be declared before it can be called (invoked).

1. Function Declaration (Named Function)

function greet() {

    console.log("Hello, welcome to JavaScript!");

}

2. Calling the Function

greet(); 

Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function
expression?
-->
In JavaScript, there are two main ways to define functions:

1. Function Declaration
2. Function Expression

Letâ€™s explore the key differences between them.

1. Function Declaration :
A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword.

- Example:

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet();

2. Function Expression
A function expression assigns a function to a variable.

- Example:

const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
};
greet();


Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
-->
    Parameters act as placeholders for values that are passed into a function.

- Example: Function with Parameters

function greet(name) {  
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);  
}
greet("Kishan");

- The return statement sends a value back to where the function was called.

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y; 
}
let result = multiply(4, 3);
console.log(result);
return x * y; sends the result back.

The returned value can be stored in a variable (result).
