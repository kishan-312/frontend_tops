Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.
--> 
    JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, usually triggered by the user or the system.
    Events can be things like clicking a button, typing in an input field, hovering over an element, or loading a webpage.

    common js events : click,mouseover,keydown,keyup 

    -> An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on an element
     and then executes a defined action when the event happens.


Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an
example.
--> 
    The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler to an HTML element. 
    It listens for a specific event (like a click or key press) and executes a function when that event occurs.

    Syntax of addEventListener() :
    element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);

    example :
    let box = document.getElementById("box");

    box.addEventListener("mouseover", function() {
        box.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
    });

    box.addEventListener("mouseout", function() {
        box.style.backgroundColor = "white";
    });
