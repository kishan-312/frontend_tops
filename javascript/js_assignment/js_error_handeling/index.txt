Question 1: What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally
blocks with an example.
--> 
    Error handling in JavaScript is the process of detecting, handling, and recovering from errors 
    that occur during code execution. It prevents the program from crashing and allows developers to 
    handle unexpected issues gracefully.

    Try, Catch, and Finally Blocks

    1. try Block
    The try block contains the code that might throw an error. If an error occurs, JavaScript stops executing the 
    try block and moves to the catch block.

    2. catch Block
    The catch block executes when an error occurs in the try block. It receives an error object that contains details
    about the error.

    3. finally Block (Optional)
    The finally block always executes, whether an error occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations
    like closing files, releasing resources, or resetting variables.  

Question 2: Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?
--> 
    Error handling is crucial in JavaScript applications because it ensures that the program runs smoothly even when 
    unexpected issues arise. Without proper error handling, applications may crash, become unresponsive, or display 
    incorrect information.
