Question 1: Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. Howare
they used for timing events?
--> 
    Both setTimeout() and setInterval() are used in JavaScript to handle time-based events.They allow you
    to execute code after a specified time interval or repeatedly at set intervals, respectively. 

    1. setTimeout()
    The setTimeout() function is used to execute a function or a block of code after a specified delay, in milliseconds.
    It runs only once after the specified time.

    Syntax:
    setTimeout(function, delay);

    2. setInterval()
    The setInterval() function is used to repeatedly execute a function or block of code at a specified time interval.
    It keeps running the specified function at the given interval until it is stopped using clearInterval().

    
    Syntax:
    setTimeout(function, interval);

    ---------------

    setTimeout():

    - Delaying an event: When you need to perform a task after waiting for a specific period, such as
    showing a popup after some time.
    - One-time action: When you only need to perform an action once after a delay.

    setInterval():

    - Repeated tasks: When you need to repeat a task, like updating the UI with live data (e.g., clock or stock prices).
    - Poll a server: Continuously check for data from a server every few seconds.




Question 2: Provide an example of how to use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2
seconds.
--> 
    console.log("Action will happen after 2 seconds...");

    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("This message is displayed after 2 seconds.");
    }, 2000);
