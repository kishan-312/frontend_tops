Question 1: Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might
you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

-->

    Web-Safe Fonts
    --------------

    Defination : 
    Web-safe fonts that are set of fonts that are commonly pre-installed on most operating system and devices

    Examples :
    Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Verdana, Georgia etc

    Characteristics : 
    - No need for extra files to load; they are already installed on the user's device
    - Ensure compatibility across most devices and browsers.

    Advantages :
    - Faster loading times
    - Reliable and consistent apperance across platforms

    Disadvantages :
    - Limited design options, which can make designs looks generic.



    Custom web Fonts
    ----------------

    Defination :
    Custom web fonts are fonts that are not pre-installed on devices but are loaded from web server or a service 
    like Google fonts.

    Examples :
    Open sans, Roboto, Poppins

    Characteristics :
    - Provide greater flexibility and creativity in design 
    - Loaded via @font-face or services like Google fonts or Adobe fonts

    Advantages :
    - Enhance branding and visual uniqueness.
    - Access to thousands of font styles and weights

    Disadvantages :
    - Slower loading times due to extra HTTP requests
    - Potential issues if the font fails to load ( required fall-back fonts )


    Why Choose Web-Safe Fonts Over Custom Fonts?
    --------------------------------------------

    - web-safe fonts do not require additional resources,leading to faster page load times,
    especially on slow internet connections.

    - web-safe fonts are ensure consistency across all devices and browser without worrying about
    font loading issues 

    - Even when using custom fonts, web-safe fonts are often set as fallbacks in case the custom font 
    fails to load.


    Example of Fallback Using Web-Safe Fonts
    ----------------------------------------
   
    body {

        font-family: 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif;

    }


Question 2: What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom GoogleFont
to a webpage?

--> 

    - The font-family property in CSS specifies the typeface (font) that should be applied to an element's text.
     You can define multiple fonts as a "fallback" list in case the browser cannot render the first font.

    Syntax of font-family :
    -----------------------

    - font-family: "Font1", "Font2", generic-family;

    Font1: The primary font you want to use.
    Font2: The fallback font if Font1 is unavailable.
    Generic-family: A general font type (serif, sans-serif, monospace, etc.) used as the ultimate fallback.
