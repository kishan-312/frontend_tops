Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?
Provide examples of semantic elements.

-->

- semantic elements means elements that clearly describe their meaning
- These elements not only describe the structure of a webpage but also 
convey meaning about the content they enclose.
- using semantic tags improve quality of your code and some benefits like accessibility and SEO

1. accessibility
- Semantic elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content more accurately.
This ensures that people with disabilities (such as blindness or low vision) can navigate and understand the 
content of a webpage.
For example, <header>, <nav>, and <footer> help screen readers understand where navigation or important sections 
of the page are located.

2. SEO 
- Search engines like Google use the structure of the HTML document to understand the content and relevance of 
the page. Semantic tags help search engines interpret the meaning of the content, improving the pageâ€™s ranking.
- For example, the use of <article> indicates that the content inside is an article, which can help search
engines index it as relevant content.
- Search engines give more weight to content placed in semantic tags, such as <header>, <footer>, 
and <main>, over content in non-semantic tags like <div>.


- examples of semantic elements are below :
1. header
2. footer
3. main 
4. section etc.
