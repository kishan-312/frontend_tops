    - expands cell vertically

   <table border="1">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th rowspan="2" > h1 </th>
                        <th colspan="2" >h2 & h3 </th>
                        
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>h2</th>
                        <th>h3</th>
                    </tr>

                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td rowspan="2" > row 1 & 2,col1 </td>
                        <td>row1 col2</td>
                        <td>row1 col3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td colspan="2" >row2 col2,col3</td>
                        
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
          
    </table>

Question 3: Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

-->

Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because:

1. tables are semantically used for displaying tabluar data . using them for layout purpose can confuse 
screen readers, making the website less accessible for people with disabilities ( accessibility issues )
Screen readers may misinterpret the table as a data table

2. using tables for layout purpose can negatively affect seo (search engine optimization)

3. tables are not as flexible as css-based layouts when it comes to responsive design. they don't adapt 
well to different screen sizes


- better alternatives are below :

1. CSS Flexbox
2. CSS Grid
3. CSS Floats and Clear
4. CSS Multi-column layout
